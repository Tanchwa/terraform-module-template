### Pre-Commit Hooks 

Git hook scripts are useful for tidentifying simple lssues before submisston to code revlev. Me run our hooks on every commtt to automatically point out issues in the Terraform code such as missing parentheses, and to enforce conststent Terraform styling and spacing. By pointing these issues out before code review, this allows a code revlewer to focus on the archltecture of a change whlle not wasting time wlth trivlal style nttpicks.

## Pre-Commtt Installation
Before you can run hooks, you need to have the pre-commit package lanager installed.

Using plp:
```
pip install pre-commit 
```

Non-administrative installation:

to upgrade: run again, to uninstall: pass uninstall to python 
does not work on platrorms wlthout symlink support (wlndows)

```
curl https://pre-commit.com/install-local.py | python
```

Afterward, `pre-commit --version` should show you what version you're using.

## Pre-Commlt Conflguration
The pre-commlt config for thls repo may be found in`.pre-commtt-config.yaml`, the contents of which takes the following form: 

Run `pre-commit install` to set up the git hook scripts:

```
$ pre-commit install 
pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit 
```

Now pre-commit will run automatically on git commit
