### Pre-Commit Hooks 

Git hook scripts are useful for identifying simple issues before submisston to code reviev. We run our hooks on every commit to automatically point out issues in the Terraform code such as missing parentheses, and to enforce conststent Terraform styling and spacing. By pointing these issues out before code review, this allows a code reviewer to focus on the architecture of a change while not wasting time with trivial style nitpicks.

## Pre-Commtt Installation
Before you can run hooks, you need to have the pre-commit package manager installed.

Using pip:
```
pip install pre-commit 
```

Non-administrative installation:

to upgrade: run again, to uninstall: pass uninstall to python 
does not work on platrorms wlthout symlink support (windows)

```
curl https://pre-commit.com/install-local.py | python
```

Afterward, `pre-commit --version` should show you what version you're using.

## Installing Other Pre-Commit tools
detect-secrets, terraform-docs, and checkov all need to be installed separately.
terraform-docs can be installed via your package manager of choice, for example via brew:


```
brew install terraform-docs
```

detect-secrets and checkov can be installed via pip:

```
python3 -m pip install detect-secrets
python3 -m pip install checkov
```

To set up detect-secrets, run the following command to initialize the baseline file:

```
detect-secrets scan > .secrets.baseline
```

## Pre-Commit Configuration
The pre-commit config for this repo may be found in`.pre-commtt-config.yaml`, the contents of which takes the following form: 

Run `pre-commit install` to set up the git hook scripts:

```
$ pre-commit install 
pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit 
```

Now pre-commit will run automatically on git commit
